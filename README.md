### What is considered best practices when designing an audio system for video games?
or
### Empirical approaches when designing an audio system for video games.

In video games audio plays an important role in communicating the atmosphere, emotion and mood of a practical environment, 
scene or situation [1].  Audio can be used to emphasise the players situation make actions more believable and help immerse
the player into game world. It can also be used to give the player instant feedback without drawing the users attention away
from the main gameplay for instance it can alert the player that they are in trouble or if they have missed an opportunity.
On the other hand, it can let the player know they have levelled up, reached a particular goal, combo or streak.
   
Audio can make or break a game, no matter how good the mechinic or gameplay is, when audio is applied badly it can ruin
a game causing bad reviews and sales to flop on the other hand when audio is applied well it can solely be responsible
for the success of the title. 

Unlike films that are inherently linear, the challenge lies in the dynamic behaviour of sound and music in games, since
the player can interact with objects in the world and a game is able to respond with visuals and audio that correspond [1].
Also, in games the developer cannot grantee how a player will move through the world the atmosphere in one area may not same
as another, for instance when a player is moving through a building with multiple rooms one room may present in a way that
something terrible happened and have a shocked atmosphere where as the room across the corridor could be calm and curious atmosphere.

So, what I want to know is how to apply audio to a game well, what are the best
practices when designing audio systems for video games?

To achieve this paper, I will first find design patterns and use cases of audio used in games such as ‘Imminent Death’
effect, ‘Sound decoys’ that distract competitors and ‘Foley’ to make situation and actions more believable [2].
 
I will then present different techniques in which the method can be applied to a game using pseudocode,
flow diagrams and UML diagrams. I will finally present my recommendation base on the augment provided.

To aid my research I will use the wealth of papers on ACM and IEEExplore for design patterns and I will also research
games that are known for great audio. To present the techniques I will follow up my research using audio programming
books from the library and online sources.
