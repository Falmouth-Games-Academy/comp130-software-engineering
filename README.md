## The problem
For a long time now there have been people exploiting video game code to malipulate it to their advantage. When applied to online games it can be disastrous. One case which got picked up by the news was virtual rape in GTA V. Hacking has also lead to games like CS:GO to add an "Overwatch" system whereby experienced players will watch the playback of a match from a suspected player reported by the community.

Both of these games have an anti-cheat of some description, which people will always find ways around. So the problem lies in the source code. For multiplayer games hacking can be reduced by moving checks to serer side although that increases the cost of server deployment and won't necessarily stop the likes of extrasensory perception or ESP for short.

## The question
What's the best way to reduce the destructiveness of hackers on online video games?
