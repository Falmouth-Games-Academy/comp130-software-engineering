which design pattern is the most appropriate for account verification and security? 

A very common problem that many players across all platforms and around the world come across is account security, more specifically, account hacking. This is where a players account is accessed by someone else who doesnâ€™t have the correct username or password to the account but finds a way to bypass this. A hacker would want to do this to destroy the accounts progress maliciously, pretend to be the player and ruin any social aspects within a game, I.E getting kicked out of a guild or clan, have access to the player's bank and card details to give to the hackers account, or to just simply get the player banned from the game. There are different design practices that many game companies use to protect a player's account. Different design practices can affect a player's mentality in different ways, I.E, feeling more at ease knowing their account is protected by a certain verification device, which I'll will explore. But more importantly I'll will be exploring the different verification methods game companies use to help protect player accounts and which of these design practices have evolved and how effective they are today as well as presenting other verification solutions.
